0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

Contextual Background
What is Web static?
Now that you've crafted a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects, it's time to breathe life into them!

Instead of diving straight into a sprawling, intricate web application, we'll take it one step at a time by building the front end gradually.

The initial step involves "designing" / "sketching" / "prototyping" each component:

- Crafting simple HTML static pages
- Establishing a style guide
- Creating placeholder content
- No JavaScript involved
- No data retrieval from external sources

Throughout this endeavor, you'll gain proficiency in manipulating HTML and CSS languages. HTML serves as the backbone of your page, constituting the initial focus. CSS, on the other hand, shapes the aesthetic design. It's highly recommended to solidify your HTML structure before delving into styling. Without a well-defined structure, applying design elements becomes challenging.

Before commencing, ensure to fork or clone the AirBnB_clone repository from your partner if you weren't the original owner of the preceding project.
