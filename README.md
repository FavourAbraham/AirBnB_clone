# AirBnB Clone
This is a AirBnb clone where we are trying to clone the Website, but it is not a full website with friendly  GUI, but works well on a console.

# Peer Work

This is a peer project that has to be done with a partner. You can check my AUTHORS file to see my partner for this project.

## Description
This project is an implementation of an AirBnB clone's command interpreter. It allows users to interact with the application through a command-line interface (CLI), performing various actions related to property rental management.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter provides a set of commands for managing and manipulating data related to property listings. Users can perform actions such as creating, updating, and deleting objects, as well as displaying information.

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script. You can enter commands interactively or use it in non-interactive mode by piping/typing required commands.
